            <li> Flour: This chocolate chip banana bread starts with all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>Bananas: You'll need to mash three ripe bananas</li>
            <li>Milk: A tablespoon of milk adds moisture.</li>

            <li>Sugar: This recipe calls for white sugar, but some Allrecipes community members like to use a blend of brown and white sugars.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Whole eggs keep the banana bread moist and help bind the batter together.</li>
            <li> Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need chocolate chips!</li>
        </ul>
